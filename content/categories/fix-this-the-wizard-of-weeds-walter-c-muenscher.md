  In previous writings of the Bergen Swamp, I have always referenced the large number of plant species richness and the large biodiversity identified at this wetland. The large number of 1,024 plant species on a small 2000 acre parcel makes the Bergen Swamp a unique New York botanical treasure.


  \

  Have you ever wondered who surveyed and identified all of these plant species in the Bergen Swamp? There were many botanist throughout a 150 year history that conducted plant surveys in the Bergen Swamp.


  \

  However, most of the plant species in the Bergen Swamp were identified and verified by one botanist, "The Wizard of Weeds," Walter Conrad Muenscher.


  \

  Dr. Muenscher was a respected Professor of Botany at Cornell University, Ithaca NY. He identified and verified 780 species in his 1946 publication "The Vegetation of Bergen Swamp: I. Vascular Plants." His survey doubled the previous known species richness identified by Stewart and Merrill in 1937. By 1951, Dr. Muenscher and other researchers working with him increased the total number to 1024 plant species in the Bergen Swamp.


  \

  At the time, Dr. Muenscher was the expert on agricultural " weed" plants. He published the textbook Weeds in 1935, which was updated with 57 editions up to 1987. This was a reference textbook for plant crop agriculture. He then published the textbook Poisonous Plants of the United States in 1939, which was also updated with 38 editions up to1975. This was an invaluable reference for the health of grazing animal husbandry. Dr. Muenscher's legacy nickname "The Wizard of Weeds" was crafted from his expertise identified by these textbook publications and the thousands of weed consultation and correspondence he shared with farmers, ranchers, private industries and government agencies.


  \

  Dr. Muenscher was also a BSPS founding member. He joined the early members to organize a society to purchase the Bergen Swamp, an environmentally unique wetland, with members' financial contributions. This was a novel concept. The first meeting minutes of the BSPS members state the distrust in governments succumbing to commercial special interests of mining, lumbering or other exploitations of public lands. In contrast, if land is purchased and held in the private trust of a society, then the members can be assured that the land will not be exploited at a later date. The BSPS was this nation's first group of private citizens organized to purchase land for environmental conservation. Sounds like a great concept, but in 1936, the BSPS land purchase was only a dream. The early BSPS had a provisional charter issued by NYS to collect land as a living museum, but the BSPS did not have the finances to purchase any land.


  \

  The founding members of the BSPS needed to encourage other people to join and contribute money to purchase the Bergen Swamp properties. The society was founded by the members of the Rochester Federation of Gardens, whose common interest was ornamental garden plantings. If the Society had a "wow" large plant count at Bergen, then this large species richness could be used as a recruitment incentive. A "wow" plant count would inspire new members to join the society and join in the financial contributions to purchase the Swamp property. I surmise that Dr. Muenscher was inspired by this revolutionary new concept of purchasing private land to be held in trust for environmental conservation.


  \

  How did Dr. Muenscher find and identify all the plant species in the Bergen Swamp? He began his Bergen Swamp plant surveys in 1917, long before the BSPS was founded. He was stationed for the summer in Batavia NY as a representative of the NYS Food Supply Commission. For that summer, he visited the swamp because of it's close proximity to his job, about ten miles away. He continued his survey as a private interest until the 1950's. In the 1940's, Dr. Muenscher accelerated the pace of this Bergen Swamp plant survey with the help of his Botany students at Cornell University. As a lab component to his Botany class, he required his students to perform plant surveys in the Bergen Swamp.


  \

  Dr. Muenscher and his Botany students began a day of survey by boarding a train in the city of Ithaca, NY. They rode the train for the 115 mile trip to the Village of Bergen, NY. They would walk the three miles from the Village of Bergen train station to the Bergen Swamp. Then they would enter the swamp to perform their plant survey and identification. They would then travel in reverse for the return trip to Ithaca. This must have been a very long day.


  \

  The decades of vegetative study culminated in his first publication of this work, The Vegetation of Bergen Swamp: I The Vascular Plants, published in the 1946 Proceedings of the Rochester Academy of Sciences. The following is the preamble to this paper:\

  \

  "BERGEN SWAMP


  A place where one may still see Nature at work and learn some of her lessons and secrets.


  A small wilderness of quiet recesses, copses and canopies where one may sojourn in undisturbed solitude for inspiration and stimulus for the future.


  An heritage from the past with the possibility of linking the present with the future until both shall have become a part of the dim past.\

  small group of pioneers who recognized an obligation of the present generation, a few years ago organized the Bergen Swamp Preservation Society to save Bergen Swamp for future generations.


  This brief account of the results of some explorations of its rich vegetation was stimulated by the efforts of these pioneers.


  it interests new recruits to join their ranks, future generations will be grateful."


  This poetic preamble in a peer reviewed scientific article is not what you would expect from a professor with a legacy of identifying which plants are "weeds" and marked for extermination. It seems that Dr. Muenscher's interaction with the BSPS members, their environmental movement and visits to the ecologically unique Bergen Swamp inspired an epiphany in this professor of weeds.


  Dr. Muenscher's 1946 publication of vascular plants in the Bergen Swamp is the first survey to identify the invasion of non-native food crop plants and ornamental plants. At this time he identified 120 of the 780 species (15%) as non-native species to the Bergen Swamp. He described these "undesirable" non-native plants as introduced by the surrounding human presence. He identified these non-native plants as "weeds" in the native flora of the Bergen Swamp. The ornamental plants such as "Japanese and European barberry and Tartarian Honeysuckle" are a "weed" when they are present in the Bergen Swamp, a native botanical sanctuary. This was a role reversal for the term "weeds," relative to his professional use of this term with the agricultural community.


  Shortly before Dr. Muenscher's 1946 publication, the BSPS purchased its first parcel in the Bergen Swamp in 1941. In 1945 the BSPS received a permanent charter from the NYS Board of Regents. Dr. Muenscher's 1946 publication was a lightning rod for recruiting new members and donations. By 1950 the BSPS purchased and owned 300 acres of the Bergen Swamp. By 1960 the BSPS owned 1900 acres of this wetland in the towns of Bergen and Byron.


  Dr. Muenscher continued to survey the Bergen Swamp by himself and with others. From 1946 to 1951, Dr Muenscher mentored or co-authored eight additional peer reviewed papers in the Proceedings of the Rochester Academy of Sciences (Muenscher 1946, Brown 1948, Muenscher 1948, Hotchkiss 1950, Rogerson and Munscher 1950, Hohn 1950, Winne 1950, Brown 1951 and Muenscher 1951). These publications increased the total number of vascular plants and bryophytes to 1,024. In addition, 634 species of fungi, 73 species of myxomycetes, 586 species of algae, and 75 species of lichens were identified in the Bergen Swamp. This biodiversity rivals a tropical rain forest.


  In 1950, Dr. Arland T. Hotchkiss, a Cornell University graduate student, published a survey of the algae in Bergen Swamp. He later served as a trustee and officer of the BSPS. Dr. Hotchkiss is a descendent of the Hotchkiss Mint family in Lyons, NY. In 1961 his daughter, Miss Anne Hotchkiss, gifted the BSPS with her family's 50 acre Hotchkiss Woodland Preserve north of Lyons in Wayne County NY.


  Dr. Muenscher retired from a 38 year career at Cornell University in 1954. He passed away in 1963. A year after his passing, the Bergen Swamp was recognized by the United States Dept. of Interior as this nation's first National Natural Landmark.


  Dr. Muenscher's daughter, Helen Tryon, is a BSPS life member. At her advanced age of 93 years, she recently sent the BSPS a nice letter with a personal witness and a sizable financial donation. She described camping as a young child with her father at the Evans farm on Torpy Hill, a glacial drumlin overlooking and bordering the Bergen Swamp. She recalls these camping experiences as one of the most memorable and exciting experiences for both her father and herself. Dr. Muenscher's daughter Joanne Droppers and his grandchildren Ralph Tryon and Peter Tryon are also BSPS life members.


  invite the reader to look at the term "weed" from Dr. Muenscher's perspective. Many of our native plants, the plants that have always been here, are labeled "weeds" and undesirable for the agricultural non-native plants and animals. If we establish a sanctuary for native plants, then this term takes on a role reversal. In the Bergen Swamp, Dr. Muenscher labeled the native plants as desirable and the non-native agriculture and ornamental plants as the undesirable "weeds." Dr. Muenscher, the Wizard of Weeds, has shown us that if we interpret the term "weed" as undesirable, then this term depends on our perspective or point of view. So, the next time you look at a "weed," I invite you to reflect on your perspective.
