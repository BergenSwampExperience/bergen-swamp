This early spring, my wife and I took a once in a lifetime "bucket list" anniversary vacation. We love Niagara Falls. We have visited the falls with our children when they were pre-teens, teens and adults. We took my father-in-law to the falls when he was succumbing to Alzheimer's. We were blessed with his recollection of where he was and what we were visiting. Who can forget Niagara Falls? It is an international natural icon. Putting others before ourselves, we always visited the falls escorting "others" such as our children, relatives or friends. We never attended alone as a couple.

\
In early spring 2013 we booked an off-season room at one of the high rise hotels on Mount Carmel, which overlooks the falls from the Canadian side. Our room was on the 27th floor, facing south with a view of the falls and the New York State horizon. We were so high up, if the building fell forward then we would have landed into the pool at the base of the falls gorge. The view of the falls was stunning. We watched the ice in the pool break up and float down river to the whirlpool.

\
This fine inspiring moment faltered when I looked up beyond the falls to the horizon on the US side. I saw the prominent landmark of elevation in the background; the landfill dump in Niagara Falls, New York. It was huge; taller than the natural elevation of Mount Carmel on which our hotel was located. I was struck by the question of contrast; "Why did we pile our garbage in view of the world's most famous, beautiful and iconic landmark? Are we mad?" Well, there it is for eternity; a landscape of trash for all international guest to see from the Canadian side. When they look at us in New York, they see the horizon landscape of a mountainous dump. This disturbing epiphany did not alter our romantic weekend, but it altered my thoughts on preservation. I felt a bit ashamed. I have been a life-long resident of New York. This mountain of trash was built during my life time. How could I have let this happen?

\
Which brings my writing to Zurich Bog, a National Natural Landmark held in trust by the BSPS. It is a quiet place with the beauty of a rare wetland flora. It is an easy site to drive by and not notice from the road. Unlike Niagara Falls, it has no five star hotels and restaurants. But it is a state and federal ecological treasure. So, "Who would build a dump there?", seems an absurd question. But that is exactly what the BSPS and Zurich committee faced in 2012 to 2013.

\
Late last 2013, the Town of Arcadia proposed to sell a closed, leaking landfill to Arcadia Hills developer Joe Alloco. This condemned town dump would be expanded into a new, much larger dump, built on top of the closed town dump. I was in disbelief because it would be right next to our Zurich Bog. This proposal would have constructed a dump taller than the glacial drumlins that frame Zurich Bog. The top of this proposed dump would be visible from the floating peat mat of the quaking bog, the sanctuary of the Zurich wetland. I initially thought that any proposal to build a dump in view of a National Natural Landmark is a foolish idea and a non-start. Then I returned home from my Niagara Falls anniversary vacation with a different perspective. I had to embrace the proposed spoilage of Zurich Bog with a neighboring dump as a real threat.

\
As a new trustee President of the BSPS, I have to confess how little I did. I really did not know how to approach this with civility. This conflict of interest in land development was borne by the BSPS Zurich committee and BSPS trustees. They sang the song of BSPS preservation and conservation to oppose this commercial landfill development. They utilized social networks (Twitter & FacebookTM), town meetings, private meetings and a technical addition to the NYS DEC SEQR (New York State environmental impact study). Their early intervention to inform others of this proposed landfill inspired other partners that voiced opposition to this landfill proposal. Soon, the local fruit farmers, the neighboring town of Sodus, the Brantling Ski Slope and a lot of local neighboring households were voicing opposition to this proposal.

\
By early summer of 2013, Joe Alloco, representing the Arcadia Hills Developer, withdrew the landfill proposal. For now, this proposal has been defeated. In contrast to Niagara Falls, Zurich Bog will not have a landfill as the apex landscape of the horizon. But this proposed change in the landscape of Zurich Bog came too close to a reality.

\
I urge all persons, especially our membership and friends, to find inspiration from our Zurich Committee and trustees. I personally admire their faith in preservation, professionalism and perseverance. They made a difference. They are living today's testament to the spirit of preservation that inspired Mary Slifer, our BSPS founder, 76 years ago. I lament that persons with their spirit were not active in Niagara Falls 80 years ago.
